Highlight:

- Function: Transaction.find_formatted(id)
  - Researched on PostgreSql how to return dates in a more friendly format
  - Also that dates can be formatted without the :ss to make it more user friendly

- Also transaction_time_formatted_html


- Getting numbers to show to 2dp on the page, using ruby's method to convert to a string
  -   <div class="cell">
        <p><%= '%.2f' % transaction.amount %></p>
      </div>

- Bug fix for if total amount of transactions = 0

      get '/' do
        @transaction = '0.00'
        @transaction = '%.2f' % Transaction.total_spent if Transaction.total_spent != nil
        erb(:index)
      end

ASK - Is it okay if some bits are only supported in chrome?

STILL NEED TOTAL SPENT TO BE DISPLAYED
