- Function: Transaction.find_formatted(id)
  - Researched on PostgreSql how to return dates in a more friendly format
  - Also that dates can be formatted without the :ss to make it more user friendly


- Getting numbers to show to 2dp on the page, using ruby's method to convert to a string
  -   <div class="cell">
        <p><%= '%.2f' % transaction.amount %></p>
      </div>
